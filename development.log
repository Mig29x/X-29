===Interface changes===
Merged in my code that:
* allows anonymous posting of Q&A and then login
* per-question email notifications via 'send_email_alerts' command
* allows space character in username
* improves openid login
* makes notification messages sticky - have to click "x" to dismiss
* unanswered questions are now those with no accepted answer
* added following setting parameters:

settings.MIN_USERNAME_LENGTH = 1 
settings.EMAIL_UNIQUE = True|False
settings.EMAIL_VALIDATION = 'on'|'off' #thought of maybe adding other options so type is string
settings.GOOGLE_SITEMAP_CODE = <string>
settings.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY = <string>

===Fixes===
* fixed incorrect answer count issue in question.html
* translated Twittwer stuff in user_preferences.html
* translated question_retag.html, except one phrase
* added Adolfo's python2.4 fix
* fixed template debugging comments so that they don't break page layout
* reorganized header template so that it takes less vertical space

===Code changes===
* wrapped template context settings into a single settings dictionary
* on login anonymous session is recorded so that anonymously posted questions (if any) could be found later
* added models: AnonymousQuestion, AnonymousAnswer, EmailFeed (for notifications)
* User model has two new fields email_key - 32 byte hex hash and email_isvalid - boolean
  file sql_scripts/update_2009_07_05_EF.sql will make upgrade to the live database
* added auth_processor to context.py which loads notification messages without deleting them
  NOTE: default django auth processor must be removed!
* added ajax actions questionSubscribeUpdates/questionUnsubscribeUpdates
